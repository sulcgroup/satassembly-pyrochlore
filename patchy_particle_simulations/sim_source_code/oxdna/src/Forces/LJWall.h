/**
 * @brief External force field that confines particles into a semispace. It can feature a short-range attraction.
 *
 * This external force is similar in spirit to RepulsionPlane but it is much more tunable. The definition of the plane is given by dir * (x,y,z) + position = 0.
 * Example section in the external forces file:

\n
{\n
  particle = -1          # acts on all particles\n
  type = LJ_plane\n
  position = 7.          # in simulation unit lengths\n
  stiff = 50.            # quite stiff. Good for MC, not for MD\n
  dir = 0.,0.,1.         # points towards positive z\n
  sigma = 1.5            # diameter of the wall
  n = 10                 # the generalised Lennard-Jones exponent, its default value is 6
  generate_inside = true # useful when generating the initial configuration
}\n\n

 * @verbatim
dir = <float>,<float>,<float> (the vector normal to the plane: it should point towards the half-plane where the repulsion is not acting.)
position = <float> (defines the position of the plane along the direction identified by the plane normal.)
particle = <int> (index of the particle on which the force shall be applied. If -1, the force will be exerted on all the particles.)
[stiff = <float> (stiffness of the repulsion. Defaults to 1.)]
[sigma = <float> ("Diameter" of the wall. It effectively rescales the distance between particle and wall. Defaults to 1.)]
[n = <int> (Exponent of the 2n-n generalized Lennard-Jones expression. Defaults to 6.)]
[only_repulsive = <bool> (If true, the interactio between particle and wall gets cut-off at the minimum, resulting in a purely-repulsive potential. Defaults to false.)]
[generate_inside = <bool> (If true the wall-particle interaction may not diverge, even for negative distances. Useful when generating the starting configuration. Defaults to false)]
