**Inverse design of a pyrochlore lattice of DNA origami through model-driven experiments**


This is a online repository for the manuscript. It contains source code for the computational pipeline of interaction design and coarse-grained simulations: 

* [Scripts](sat_solver_scripts/) for formulating lattice design as a SAT problem and converting the solution to interaction matrix

* [Patchy particle simulations](patchy_particle_simulations/) contains source code and setup for patchy particles simulations

* [oxDNA Simulations](oxdna_simulations) contains a folder with the crystal stability simulations, and the relaxed monomer.
To assemble the crystal simulation files (as they exceed 100MB each, over github filesize limit) you have to run the `./oxdna_simulations/assemble.sh` file.
