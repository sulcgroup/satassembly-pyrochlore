**Inverse design of a pyrochlore lattice of DNA origami through model-driven experiments**


This is a online repository for the manuscript. It contains source code for the computational pipeline of interaction design and coarse-grained simulations: 

* [Scripts](sat_solver_scripts/) for formulating lattice design as a SAT problem and converting the solution to interaction matrix

* [Patchy particle simulations](patchy_particle_simulations/)

* [OxDNA Simulations](oxdna_simulations)
